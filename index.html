To make this healthy and delicious salad: <br>
1. Heat oven to 350* F. Spread the nuts on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in oven, tossing occasionally, until fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes. Rub the warm nuts between 2 clean dish towels to remove the skins (discard the skins). <br>
2. Whisk together the oil, vinegar, mustard, and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Add the radicchio, romaine, prosciutto, scallions, apple, and nuts and toss to combine. Serve immediately. <br>

To make this juicy steak dinner, follow these steps: <br>
1. Heat oven to 400* F. Place potatoes on a plate and microwave, uncovered, on high for 12 minutes. <br>
2. Meanwhile, heat the oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Season steak with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. <br>
3. Cook steak for 1 minute per side. Transfer to oven and cook to desired doneness, 6 to 8 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board. <br>
4. In a bowl, combine the sour cream, lemon juice, vinegar (if desired), 2 tablespoons water, 2 tablespoons chives, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. <br>
5. Divide the sliced steak, potatoes, and arugula among individual plates. Drizzle the potatoes and arugula with the sour cream mixture and sprinkle with the chives and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. <br>

1. Heat oven to 350* F. In a medium skillet, over medium heat, heat the oil with the onion, garlic, and jalapeno and cook until the vegetables are tender but not browned, about 10 minutes. Add the salt, oregano, and nutmeg. Remove from heat. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, then blend in the milk and bread crumbs. Add the meat and cooked vegetables and stir or work with your hands to combine. Shape into 1 1/2-inch balls. <br>
2. Saute over medium-high heat in olive oil a few meatballs at a time. Remove them when they are well browned on all sides. <br>
3. Pour off the fat and return the meatballs to the skillet. Top with two 26-ounce jars prepared marinara sauce. Simmer over low heat 10 minutes. Serve half the meatballs over cooked spaghetti. Reserve the remaining meatballs for subs. <br>
